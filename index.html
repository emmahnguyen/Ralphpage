        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! I am Ralph Mutai, 22 years old, and I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at UHD. It has been a journey. As I am almost done, I hope to land a well-paying remote job in cyber security or UX/UI design. Growing up, it was not my plan to pursue this course. I actually wanted to be a pilot, but after high school, I really started getting into graphic and web design, hence my decision to pursue Computer Science.
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, I grew up in Kenya, and my family and I came to the United States 7 years ago for a better future. I am bilingual, and I speak two languages. My dream is to own a couple of businesses and travel across the world, being a blessing to other people.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my free time, I love working on different projects to further gain knowledge in computer science. My favorite website is <a href="https://leetcode.com/explore/" target="_blank">LeetCode</a>.
